# Clock App

A [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) application with bunch of interesting functions.
This application was built without any architecture packages in order to demonstrate my programming skills.
Architecture is deliberately created by [Me](https://github.com/JollyGoal/) using flutter's default state management system and dart:async, so even the built-in options like StreamBuilder were excluded.
